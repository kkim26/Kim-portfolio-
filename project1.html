                <p>Smart Sprout was a Bits of Good Design Bootcamp project and I collaborated with a partner. We designed a web extension and website that would reduce impulse spending and instill financially healthy habits.</p>

            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide2.png" alt="Slide 2">
                <p>As college students with a low budget, we found a problem with impulse purchases especially with the ease of online shopping and social media pressures. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide3.png" alt="Slide 3">
                <p>So we began our project by first researching competitors and planning our interview goals. For our interviews we wanted to make sure we were presenting unbias questions and instead tried to see from a consumer point of view thier thinking process and perspective.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide4.png" alt="Slide 4">
                <p>We did five in-depth, 30 minute interviews with people ranging from highschool to post grad, and we found that impulse purchases were easier when it was convenient(autofill, applepay, etc.), and there was a pressure (social, trends/influencers, sale timers). Interviewees also mentioned that when they logically thought-out a purchase there was greater satisfaction. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide5.png" alt="Slide 5">
                <p>From the interviews we decided to create a website and web-extention together. The website would help instill healthy buying habits by keeping track of purchases and gammifying it. The web extension would make a fast and impulsive checkout more inconvienent and so force a consumer to slow down and think more logically about their purchases. This is the user-flow for the website</p>

            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide6.png" alt="Slide 6">
                <p>This is the user-flow for the web extention.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide7.png" alt="Slide 7">
                <p>We started the low fidelity designs for our website and web extension.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide8.png" alt="Slide 8">
                <p>Then we moved on to mid fidelity designs. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide9.png" alt="Slide 9">
                <p>Before constructing our final draft we conducted user testing to implement feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide10.png" alt="Slide 10">
                <p>These are our final high-fidelity designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide11.png" alt="Slide 11">
                <p>Here are some of our design highlights. This is our web-extention that would pop-up right before the user checks out and it forces them to think logically. In the top right corner there is a way to disable the questionaire if it is a circumstance where you need a fast checkout (tickets, emergency).</p>

            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide12.png" alt="Slide 12">
                <p>On the website there is a way to track your purchases so you are aware of your spending.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide13.png" alt="Slide 13">
                <p>Also on the website, you can connect with friends and see each other's avatars and spending habits as an added point of accountability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-slide">
                <img src="slide14.png" alt="Slide 14">
                <p>Also on the website, there is a gammification aspect, where the money you do not spend from your set budget, you can use to take care, and accessorize your plant avatar. The gammification is so that users have motivation to keep up with having healthy spending habits and to not go over their budget.</p>
